# Mass Assigner

Mass Assigner is a powerful tool designed to identify and exploit mass assignment vulnerabilities in web applications. It achieves this by first retrieving data from a specified request, such as fetching user profile data. Then, it systematically attempts to apply each parameter extracted from the response to a second request provided, one parameter at a time. This approach allows for the automated testing and exploitation of potential mass assignment vulnerabilities. **This code is made for security enthusiasts and professionals only. Use it at your own risk.**

## ðŸª„ Features

- Enables the addition of custom headers within requests
- Offers customization of various HTTP methods for both origin and target requests
- Supports rate-limiting to manage request thresholds effectively
- Provides the option to specify "ignored parameters" which the tool will ignore during execution

### ðŸ”® What's Next 
- Support additional content types, such as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
- Improving the support in nested arrays/objects inside JSON data in responses
